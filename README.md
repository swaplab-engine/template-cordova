This repository hosts a curated collection of production-ready starter templates for building Android & iOS apps using **Cordova**.

We have modernized, sanitized, and pre-configured these popular community templates to ensure they work seamlessly with the [SwapLab Build Service](https://swaplab.net).

## 🚀 How to Test in 30 Seconds (Upload Method)

You can test any of these templates instantly without connecting your GitHub account:

1. **Download:** Click the green **`<> Code`** button at the top of this repository and select **Download ZIP**.
2. **Extract:** Unzip the downloaded file to your computer.
3. **Select Framework:** Open the extracted folder and locate the specific template you want to use (e.g., `cordova-app-hello-world`).
4. **Compress (Crucial Step):** Zip that specific project folder. 
   > **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** You must zip the **folder itself** (e.g., `cordova-app-hello-world.zip`). Do not go inside the folder and zip the internal files. The root of your `.zip` archive must be the project directory.
5. **Upload:** Go to [public.swaplab.net](https://public.swaplab.net) or [private.swaplab.net](https://private.swaplab.net), upload your `.zip` file, and trigger the build.
